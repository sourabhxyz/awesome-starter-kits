## Atlas Examples Kit

Examples to illustrate usage of Atlas:-

* `bet-ref`: âš¡ Learn how to leverage Atlas by building a complete end-to-end dApp, see it's tutorial [here](https://atlas-app.io/getting-started).
* `vesting`: Dr. Lars illustrating Atlas, using his with favourite example, Vesting. See the walkthrough [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rapjgIuGWJw).

To dive deeper into the Atlas implementation, see its [Haddock](https://haddock.atlas-app.io/).

## Features of Atlas

### Easily build transactions
Use an intuitive API to abstract away the complexity around building transactions, balancing UTxOs, and interfacing with Plutus smart contracts.

### Leverage first-class Haskell
Avoid code duplication between on-chain and off-chain code, interoperate with advanced functionalities offered by IOG's Cardano/Plutus libraries, and easily convert between Atlas and Cardano/Plutus types.

### Utilize modular data providers
Query ledger state information from [Maestro](https://www.gomaestro.org/dapp-platform), a local node or [Cardano DB Sync](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-db-sync). You can also build and contribute your own data provider!

### Test extensively
Use Atlas' test harness to write realistic [unit tests](https://atlas-app.io/getting-started/unit-tests) that correspond to on-chain behavior, and execute [integration tests](https://atlas-app.io/getting-started/integration-tests) against cardano node in a private network.

### Stay up to date
Benefit from Cardano's latest innovations such as **Reference Inputs**, **Inline Datums** and **Reference Scripts**.
